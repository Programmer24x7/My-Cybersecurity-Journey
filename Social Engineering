Social engineering is a technique used by attackers to manipulate or trick people into revealing sensitive information, performing certain actions, or breaking normal security protocols — without hacking any system directly.

Think of it as "hacking humans instead of machines."

Real-Life Example:
An attacker calls a company pretending to be from the IT department. They say there’s a security update needed and ask the employee to share their login credentials. The employee believes it and gives access — now the attacker can log into internal systems.

How to Defend Against It:
Don’t share passwords or OTPs, even with "official" callers.

Verify identities — if someone says they're from IT or HR, call the official number to check.

Be suspicious of urgency — attackers often create panic (e.g., “your account will be deleted!”).

Report unusual emails, calls, or requests to your security team.
