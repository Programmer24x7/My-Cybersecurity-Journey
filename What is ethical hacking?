Ethical hacking is the legal and authorized process of testing systems, networks, or applications to find and fix security vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them.
In simple words: It’s hacking — but with permission and for a good purpose.

Who Performs Ethical Hacking?

People known as Ethical Hackers or White Hat Hackers.
They use the same tools and techniques as attackers, but:
With authorization
To help secure systems 
And not break the law.

Goals of Ethical Hacking: 

Find security flaws (bugs, misconfigurations, weak passwords)
Help companies improve cybersecurity
Simulate real-world attacks safely
Prevent data breaches and cybercrime
