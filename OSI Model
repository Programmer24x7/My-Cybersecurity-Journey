The OSI model (or Open Systems Interconnection Model) is an essential model used in networking.  
This critical model provides a framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data.

One of the main benefits of the OSI model is that devices can have different functions and designs on a network while communicating with other devices. 
Data sent across a network that follows the uniformity of the OSI model can be understood by other devices.

The OSI model consists of seven layers which are illustrated in the down below. Each layer has a different set of responsibilities and is arranged from Layer 7 to Layer 1.

At every individual layer that data travels through, specific processes take place, and pieces of information are added to this data, 
which is what we'll come to discuss in the upcoming tasks within this room. 
However, for now, we only need to understand that this process is called encapsulation.

The OSI Model layers: 

7 --> Application
6 --> Presentation
5 --> Session
4 --> Transport
3 --> Network
2 --> Data Link Layer
1 --> Physical Layer.

The numbering starts with the physical layer being layer 1, while the top layer, the application layer, is layer 7. 
To help you remember the layers from bottom to top, you can use a mnemonic such as “Please Do Not Throw Spinach Pizza Away.” 
You can check the Internet for other easy-to-remember acronyms if this helps you memorise them. 
Remembering the OSI model layers with their layer numbers is important; otherwise, you will struggle to understand terms such as “layer 3 switch” or “layer 7 firewall.”
